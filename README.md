# School_District_Analysis
schoolpython
The purpose of this analysis is to find out the differences (money,student population, District, public/charter)in schools and how they did in Math and Reading
- schools smaller in size faired better
- schools that spent less money faired better
- allowed budget to go to better schools 
- allowed to analyze which schools could benefit from funds distributed to them
- higher population may need additional funds to provide more resources to the kids
- allowed analysis between grades 9-12
- charter schools faired better in overall passing of both reading and math
- 
This has allowed the team to allocate resources to the better schools as well as help provide additional resources to those school with larger class sizes. 

The school analysis were all affected in a variety of ways. From funds being used resourcfully, to grades worse with bigger class size. Schools like Bailey High, Figueroa and Ford High did extermely poorly regarding overall passing. Although, most schools that spent less the money per student had test scores that were much better like  Cabrera, Holden and Pena High School they also had the benefit of being a smaller school. 

The four changes that I would maketo the school are 
1- spend less money
2- have smaller schools
3 Charter is greater than District 
4- biger schools the higher the grade level the less likely the students will do better.
